#The first deployment contains configuration for deploying a sipmle front application developped with angular and typescript
exposed on Port 80 
and Then i created a NodePort service so i gonna be possible to access the application from outside the cluster 
==> when using NodePort service will automaticly expose the port and a full url to acess the application.
